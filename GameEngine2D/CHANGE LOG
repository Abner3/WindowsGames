rev 1.0 (initial release)

AbstractGame
* The game constructor allows you to set seize for the frame as well as whether it is resizable or not
* a game loop which runs with constant 60 fps
* ability to add screen and set screen to one's on the list
* ability to add key listener to the frame
* ability to set default close operation for the frame

Entity
* a game objects which requires x and y coordinates as well as game objects
* getters and setters for the x and y coordinates
* entity implements Runnable therefore can be run on a separate thread

BoundingBox
* a constructor to set x, y, width, height
* getters and setters for the fields
* absolute collision between the current and another bounding box

Screen 
* a class which extends JPanel where all graphics will be draws on;
* takes a game object

=================================================================================

rev 1.1 (update 1)

AbstractGame
* ability to get the window (JFrame)
* ability to add threads and run threads
* ability to getters and setters for running
* getters and setters for sprite sheet
* ability to set sprite sheet from local directory
* ability to get sub-image of a sprite using specific x, y, width and height
* pause method needed

Entity
* getters and setters for image
* ability to set Image using a specific portion of the sprite sheet.
* ability to set image using local directory

BoundingBox
* fixed collision

==================================================================================

rev 1.3 (update 2) [devBranch]

* removed BoundingBox and replaced with RectangleBoundingShape which is an inner static class inside Engine2DBoundingShape

Entity
* now entity requires you to set Either RectangleBoundingShape or Engine2DBoundingShape
* public field to get either type of BoundingBox

New features:

New Type of Entity
* now Entity is one that not runnable however you can use Movable Entity which is runnable and will run on a separate thread

New Boundingbox Box Shape
* Polygon bounding box
* Polygon bounding box movement, get xpoints, ypoints
* ability to get the area
* ability to get polygon representing the bounding box

Threading
* support for multi-threading using either movable polygon entity or rectangle entity
* game runs on separate thread

Game Loop
* ability to stop main loop and resume it abstract method for different states *pause, gameOver
* now gameLoop() should only contains code to run when game is running and game over is not true

==================================================================================

rev 1.3.1 (update 3) [devBranch]

* removed the public BoundingBox fields
* changed structure and renamed all classes so the prefix is "Engine2D"

New feature:

Multiple Entity type
* different type of entity: RectangleEntity, MovableRectangleEntity, PolygonEntity, MovablePolygonEntity
  and plain Entity which doesn't have a bounding box
  
Entity Loop
* ability to stop loop

BoundingBox collision
* static area collision method added
* different type of collision techniques for the polygon bounding box

==============================================================================

rev 1.3.2 (update 4)

* fixed polygon collision

New feature:

Game

* added ability to get threads list (protected access)
* added ability to get main game thread (protected access)

Polygon Bounding Box

* added minX can be used similar way as getX() for rectangle bounding box
* added maxX can be used similar way as getWidth() for rectangle bounding box
* added minY can be used similar way as getY() for rectangle bounding box
* added maxY can be used similar way as getHeight() for rectangle bounding box
* added methods to set and get center points

==============================================================================

rev 1.4 (update 5)

New feature:

Game

* added GameEventDispatcher Thread class which allows the ability to submit runnable task to a queue
  to be processed using FIFO
* added new ArrayLsit called GameArrayList - it is a special type of list which only allows you to
  add or remove element from the list on the GameEventDispatcher Thread
* changed gameLoop to make it run at constant rate, on a new thread

Bounding Box

* changed structure two two separate classes which extends Engine2DBoundingBox
* added main method such as setX(), setY(), getCenterX(), getCenterY() etc.

Entity

* changed structure so that there are only two classes Entity and MovableEntity, but now you have the
  ability to set bounding box
* Movable entity loop changed to loop similar to the main GameThread loop
